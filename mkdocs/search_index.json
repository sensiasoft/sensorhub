Other users may be interested by your modules and bug fixes! \n\n\nOf course, contributing new modules to the community is optional as our license does not prevent proprietary and commercial derived work. However, keep in mind that \nif you modify the source files we provide, you must make it available publicly in source form\n. \n\n\nThis page provides instructions for three possible options, depending on your level of involvement:\n\n\n\n\nExploring the code online\n\n\nDownloading and building from source with Maven or Eclipse\n\n\nContributing software and fixes to the project\n\n\n\n\nExploring the Code\n\n\nIf you just want to explore the code, you can browse the source online directly on \nGithub\n. Alternatively, you can download it to your computer using the \nDownload ZIP\n link on each GitHub repository or using the \ngit\n program (please see the next section if you want to do just that).\n\n\nTo start with, the repositories of interest are \nOpenSensorHub Core\n and \nSensor Drivers\n.\n\n\nBuilding from Source\n\n\nBelow are the steps to download and build the code using either command line tools or the Eclipse IDE.\n\n\nUsing Command-Line Tools\n\n\nIf you want to build the code and run it on your computer, you'll need \ngit\n and \nMaven 3\n.\nTo clone the code repository locally, first create a directory called \nopensensorhub\n (or anything else you want really) and \ncd\n in this directory:\n\n\n$ mkdir opensensorhub\n$ cd opensensorhub\n\n\n\n\nThen and use the following commands to clone the two main repositories:\n\n\n$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/opensensorhub/osh-core\n$ git clone https://github.com/opensensorhub/osh-sensors\n\n\n\n\nThis will create folders containing the code of the different Maven modules. You can also clone other repositories of the project to get other types of modules. The \nservices\n and \nsecurity\n repositories are probably of interest if you want to go further. There are also some Android specific modules in the \nandroid\n repository if you are interested in deploying on Android.\n\n\nYou can then build the project and install it to your local Maven repository by launching the following commands:\n\n\nFirst build the core modules:\n\n\n$ cd core\n$ mvn clean install \n\n\n\n\nThen build the sensor drivers you are interested in. To start with, you can build the simulated sensor since they don't require you to connect any hardware.\n\n\n$ cd ../osh-sensors/sensorhub-driver-fakegps\n$ mvn clean install\n$ cd ../sensorhub-driver-fakeweather\n$ mvn clean install\n\n\n\n\nNote 1: The first time you launch Maven, the build process can take a while because Maven goes to fetch its own dependencies (i.e. Maven plugins) as well as OpenSensorHub's dependencies. Later builds will go faster because these dependencies are cached in a local Maven repository.\n\n\nNote 2: Some of the JUnit tests automatically run during the 'test' phase of the OSH build process need to instantiate a server on port 8888. These tests will fail if something else is running on this port when you launch the commands above.\n\n\nYou can then run OpenSensorHub with an example configuration file. For instance, the following command launches OpenSensorHub configured with some simulated sensors, storage databases and an SOS service:\n\n\n$ cd ../../osh-core/sensorhub-test\n$ mvn -N -e exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=\norg.sensorhub.impl.SensorHub\n -Dexec.args=\nsensorhub-test/src/test/resources/config_fakesensors_with_storage.json db\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing Eclipse\n\n\nWe provide Eclipse project configuration directly from the repository so it is the easiest way to get started, especially if you're already familiar with Eclipse. \n\n\nPre-requisites\n\n\nMake sure you have the following Eclipse components installed:\n\n\n\n\nEclipse Helios or newer (the exact steps described here are for Luna)\n\n\nEgit plugin for Eclipse (included in \"Eclipse IDE for Java Developers\" release)\n\n\nMaven plugin for Eclipse M2E (you can install it using the \"Help \n Install New Software..\". You will find it under the \"Collaboration\" section of the Eclipse releases repository) \n\n\n\n\nClone the project in your Eclipse workspace\n\n\n\n\nIn the Package Explorer, right click and select \"Import\" from the popup menu\n\n\nOpen the \"Git\" category, select \"Projects from Git\" and click \"Next\"\n\n\nSelect \"Clone URI\" and click \"Next\"\n\n\nIn the \"URI\" text box, enter the URL of the OpenSensorHub Core repository \nhttps://github.com/opensensorhub/osh-core.git\n and click \"Next\"\n\n\nLeave \"master\" selected and click \"Next\"\n\n\nYou can leave the Directory settings as-is on this page or change it to the location of your choice (Note that the Egit manual discourages cloning directly in the Eclipse workspace for performance reasons, however we haven't had any issue doing this with the opensensorhub code base. If you want to do like us, change the \"Directory\" to points directly to a sub-directory of your Eclipse workspace, for instance, \"/home/user/workspace/osh-core\")\n\n\nSelect \"Clone submodules\" and click \"Next\"\n\n\nAfter the download is complete, leave \"Import existing projects\" selected and click \"Next\"\n\n\nLeave all projects selected and click \"Finish\"\n\n\nAll projects should be imported successfully and visible in the \"Package Explorer\". Everything should compile without error.\n\n\nIf you like to keep your workspace tidy, you can group all the projects we just imported in a single Working Set\n\n\n\n\nRepeat the steps above with the desired repositories of the opensensorhub github account. You'll need at least some sensor drivers to test the software. You can get these from the following repository:\n\n\nhttps://github.com/opensensorhub/osh-sensors.git\n\n\nThere may be other repositories of interest for you:\n\n\n\n\nAndroid: \nhttps://github.com/opensensorhub/osh-android.git\n\n\nOther Services : \nhttps://github.com/opensensorhub/osh-services.git\n\n\nData-Processing : \nhttps://github.com/opensensorhub/osh-processing.git\n\n\nSecurity Stuff : \nhttps://github.com/opensensorhub/osh-security.git\n\n\n\n\nContributing\n\n\nIf you want to contribute, we feel the best way is that you create your own fork on GitHub, work on it, and when you have something working and tested, send us a Pull Request. To set this up, please follow the steps below:\n\n\nFork one or more repository of the project\n\n\nThe first step is to fork a repo by clicking the \nFork\n button on GitHub. This will clone the original code to your own GitHub account so you can then modify it and/or add to it as you wish. For this you'll need to have a GitHub account (it can be done in 30s using your email address) and log into it.\n\n\nForking the project this way will allow you to send us \nPull Requests\n via GitHub which makes it much easier for us to incorporate your contribution to the master branch. In addition, it creates a community around the software and lets others see what contributors are up to even before a patch is submitted. This can help you get the proper guidance when necessary.\n\n\nClone your GitHub repository\n\n\nClone your new GitHub repository locally by following the steps in the \nBuilding from Source\n section except you'll be using your own fork URL (e.g. https://github.com/yourusername/osh-*\n) instead of the \nopensensorhub\n version.\n\n\nWork on something new!\n\n\nYou can then start modifying the code and/or add new modules/features. We don't have coding guidelines yet but try to mimic the code that is already there. Don't forget to include Javadoc, especially on public parts of your APIs, and also inline comments explaining the different steps of your code.\n\n\nWhether you're trying to fix bugs or adding a brand new functionality, don't hesitate to tell us early-on what you're planning to work on. We may be able to point you in the right direction or maybe to somebody who has similar needs than you.\n\n\nYou can start by reading the instructions to \nCreate a New Module\n and \nAdd a New Sensor Driver\n for instance.\n\n\nAlso see the \nEclipse Tips\n section if you encounter problems while creating a new module.\n\n\nGet the latest updates from us\n\n\nWhile you're working on your stuff, don't forget to pull changes from the main repository once in a while.

            "text": "This guide is meant to help you setup a development environment based on the Eclipse IDE so that you can extend OpenSensorHub (OSH for short) with your own sensor drivers, web services and other components.  Don't forget to send us a Pull Request if you want to contribute your work back to this project. Other users may be interested by your modules and bug fixes!   Of course, contributing new modules to the community is optional as our license does not prevent proprietary and commercial derived work. However, keep in mind that  if you modify the source files we provide, you must make it available publicly in source form .   This page provides instructions for three possible options, depending on your level of involvement:   Exploring the code online  Downloading and building from source with Maven or Eclipse  Contributing software and fixes to the project   Exploring the Code  If you just want to explore the code, you can browse the source online directly on  Github . Alternatively, you can download it to your computer using the  Download ZIP  link on each GitHub repository or using the  git  program (please see the next section if you want to do just that).  To start with, the repositories of interest are  OpenSensorHub Core  and  Sensor Drivers .  Building from Source  Below are the steps to download and build the code using either command line tools or the Eclipse IDE.  Using Command-Line Tools  If you want to build the code and run it on your computer, you'll need  git  and  Maven 3 .\nTo clone the code repository locally, first create a directory called  opensensorhub  (or anything else you want really) and  cd  in this directory:  $ mkdir opensensorhub\n$ cd opensensorhub  Then and use the following commands to clone the two main repositories:  $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/opensensorhub/osh-core\n$ git clone https://github.com/opensensorhub/osh-sensors  This will create folders containing the code of the different Maven modules. You can also clone other repositories of the project to get other types of modules. The  services  and  security  repositories are probably of interest if you want to go further. There are also some Android specific modules in the  android  repository if you are interested in deploying on Android.  You can then build the project and install it to your local Maven repository by launching the following commands:  First build the core modules:  $ cd core\n$ mvn clean install   Then build the sensor drivers you are interested in. To start with, you can build the simulated sensor since they don't require you to connect any hardware.  $ cd ../osh-sensors/sensorhub-driver-fakegps\n$ mvn clean install\n$ cd ../sensorhub-driver-fakeweather\n$ mvn clean install  Note 1: The first time you launch Maven, the build process can take a while because Maven goes to fetch its own dependencies (i.e. Maven plugins) as well as OpenSensorHub's dependencies. Later builds will go faster because these dependencies are cached in a local Maven repository.  Note 2: Some of the JUnit tests automatically run during the 'test' phase of the OSH build process need to instantiate a server on port 8888. These tests will fail if something else is running on this port when you launch the commands above.  You can then run OpenSensorHub with an example configuration file. For instance, the following command launches OpenSensorHub configured with some simulated sensors, storage databases and an SOS service:  $ cd ../../osh-core/sensorhub-test\n$ mvn -N -e exec:java -Dexec.mainClass= org.sensorhub.impl.SensorHub  -Dexec.args= sensorhub-test/src/test/resources/config_fakesensors_with_storage.json db   Using Eclipse  We provide Eclipse project configuration directly from the repository so it is the easiest way to get started, especially if you're already familiar with Eclipse.   Pre-requisites  Make sure you have the following Eclipse components installed:   Eclipse Helios or newer (the exact steps described here are for Luna)  Egit plugin for Eclipse (included in \"Eclipse IDE for Java Developers\" release)  Maven plugin for Eclipse M2E (you can install it using the \"Help   Install New Software..\". You will find it under the \"Collaboration\" section of the Eclipse releases repository)    Clone the project in your Eclipse workspace   In the Package Explorer, right click and select \"Import\" from the popup menu  Open the \"Git\" category, select \"Projects from Git\" and click \"Next\"  Select \"Clone URI\" and click \"Next\"  In the \"URI\" text box, enter the URL of the OpenSensorHub Core repository  https://github.com/opensensorhub/osh-core.git  and click \"Next\"  Leave \"master\" selected and click \"Next\"  You can leave the Directory settings as-is on this page or change it to the location of your choice (Note that the Egit manual discourages cloning directly in the Eclipse workspace for performance reasons, however we haven't had any issue doing this with the opensensorhub code base. If you want to do like us, change the \"Directory\" to points directly to a sub-directory of your Eclipse workspace, for instance, \"/home/user/workspace/osh-core\")  Select \"Clone submodules\" and click \"Next\"  After the download is complete, leave \"Import existing projects\" selected and click \"Next\"  Leave all projects selected and click \"Finish\"  All projects should be imported successfully and visible in the \"Package Explorer\". Everything should compile without error.  If you like to keep your workspace tidy, you can group all the projects we just imported in a single Working Set   Repeat the steps above with the desired repositories of the opensensorhub github account. You'll need at least some sensor drivers to test the software. You can get these from the following repository:  https://github.com/opensensorhub/osh-sensors.git  There may be other repositories of interest for you:   Android:  https://github.com/opensensorhub/osh-android.git  Other Services :  https://github.com/opensensorhub/osh-services.git  Data-Processing :  https://github.com/opensensorhub/osh-processing.git  Security Stuff :  https://github.com/opensensorhub/osh-security.git   Contributing  If you want to contribute, we feel the best way is that you create your own fork on GitHub, work on it, and when you have something working and tested, send us a Pull Request. To set this up, please follow the steps below:  Fork one or more repository of the project  The first step is to fork a repo by clicking the  Fork  button on GitHub. This will clone the original code to your own GitHub account so you can then modify it and/or add to it as you wish. For this you'll need to have a GitHub account (it can be done in 30s using your email address) and log into it.  Forking the project this way will allow you to send us  Pull Requests  via GitHub which makes it much easier for us to incorporate your contribution to the master branch. In addition, it creates a community around the software and lets others see what contributors are up to even before a patch is submitted. This can help you get the proper guidance when necessary.  Clone your GitHub repository  Clone your new GitHub repository locally by following the steps in the  Building from Source  section except you'll be using your own fork URL (e.g. https://github.com/yourusername/osh-* ) instead of the  opensensorhub  version.  Work on something new!  You can then start modifying the code and/or add new modules/features. We don't have coding guidelines yet but try to mimic the code that is already there. Don't forget to include Javadoc, especially on public parts of your APIs, and also inline comments explaining the different steps of your code.  Whether you're trying to fix bugs or adding a brand new functionality, don't hesitate to tell us early-on what you're planning to work on. We may be able to point you in the right direction or maybe to somebody who has similar needs than you.  You can start by reading the instructions to  Create a New Module  and  Add a New Sensor Driver  for instance.  Also see the  Eclipse Tips  section if you encounter problems while creating a new module.  Get the latest updates from us  While you're working on your stuff, don't forget to pull changes from the main repository once in a while. This will greatly help us merge your changes into the main branch when we receive your Pull Request. You can either do that from command line git or within Eclipse:  Using the  git  command  First add a new remote pointing to the  opensensorhub  master branch (you only have to do that the first time). For example, for the osh-core repository:  $ git remote add upstream https://github.com/opensensorhub/osh-core  Then pull changes from the \"upstream\" remote:  $ git pull upstream master\n$ git submodule update  Note 1: The  submodule update  command is only required in the  osh-core  repo that has submodules.  Note 2: that you may have to manually merge things with your working copy if you have made conflicting changes.  Using Eclipse  First add a new remote pointing to the  opensensorhub  master branch (you only have to do that the first time):   Open the \"Git Repositories\" view (Window -  Show view -  Other -  Git)  Open the \"sensorhub\" repository, right click on \"Remotes\" and select \"Create Remote\"  Enter \"upstream\" as the remote name, select \"Configure fetch\" and click \"OK\"  Click the \"Change\" button next to the URI text box  Enter  https://github.com/opensensorhub/osh-core  as the URI and click \"Finish\"  Click \"Save\"   Then pull changes from the \"upstream\" remote:   Open the \"Git Repositories\" view (Window -  Show view -  Other -  Git)  Right click on the \"osh-core\" repository and select \"Remote -  Fetch\" in the popup menu  Select the \"opensensorhub\" remote in the \"Configured remote repository\" item and click \"Finish\"  Right click on the \"Submodules\" folder and select \"Update Submodule\" from the popup menu   You'll then eventually have to merge our changes with yours using the Egit merge command. Please see  Git Documentation  for more details  Note: Also don't forget to import new Eclipse projects that may have been added since your last update. For this, follow these steps:   Right click in your workspace and select \"Import...\" in the context menu  Select \"Existing project into workspace\" from the \"General\" section and click \"Next\"  Browse to the folder where you cloned our repo (usually called \"osh-core\" for the core software)  Select the missing projects in the list (all the projects that are not already in your workspace should already be selected) and click \"Finish\"      Push your changes to your own repo  You can push your changes to your own GitHub repo at any time, even if your code doesn't work yet. Remember this is your own sandbox so you won't mess up anybody else code base. We actually recommend that you do that often since it will provide you a good backup of your work, with full history.

A simple API and several storage implementations are provided as part of the SensorHub software :    The  PERST  based storage uses a pure Java embedded object database which allows very efficient storage of data with a very small footprint (typically for embedded devices). See the [DataPersistencePERST PERST persistence page] for more details.    The  PostgreSQL/PostGIS  storage allows storing of SWE Common data in a robust SQL database but requires more powerful hardware and a database server to run.    In both cases, the database schema used is generic and can be used to store any data structure described in SWE Common and allows indexes on the specified fields.  The administration console allows the user to select what messages are to be stored and how (i.e. table name, what indexes should be created, etc.).  Web Service Modules  Web services can be developed and connected to other SensorHub modules to provide remote access to the different functions. SensorHub software already contains useful OGC services designed to communicate bi-directionnally with the connected sensors:    The Sensor Observation Service (SOS)  is connected to the bus and to the persistent storage and allows retrieval of historical data as well as real-time data measurements.    The Sensor Planning Service (SPS)  is connected to the bus and allows to send commands to the connected sensor.    A simple  Web Feature Service (WFS)  is connected to the sensor registry and allows one to retrieve the full SensorML descriptions of all connected sensors as well as simplified features containing only the name and location of the sensors for display on a map.    All web services are configurable through the administration web interface but most of the configuration is extracted automatically from the SensorML description of the sensors. The user mainly selects what sensor outputs should be exposed through SOS and/or what sensor parameters should be able to receive commands from SPS.  Processing Modules  The processing module is connected to the bus and the persistent storage and allows deployment of several processing instances that can either process data transiting on the bus (aka event-based or streaming processing) or process data from the storage on-demand (aka on-demand processing).

However, the use of SensorML is not required and one can also write a plain Java plugin compliant with the processing API for implementing a particular algorithm.  Example Deployment  The diagram below shows an example OSH instance configured with one sensor, one processing module, one storage module, SOS and SPS web services :     The sensor is connected via a proper sensor driver that pushes data to the bus as soon as it's available. Full description of the data structure is made available to other module via the sensor API.    The processing module instance listens to new sensor data and processes it as soon as it's available. The result is pushed back to the bus. Inputs and outputs are fully described in SensorML.    The storage module instance listens to both raw sensor and processed data and archives it all in a file or database. The archived data is then indexed and made available via the persistence API.

            "text": "Your First Sensor Driver\n\n\nThis is a tutorial to help you write your first sensor driver, based on the \nFake Weather\n demo module that is provided with SensorHub source and binary releases. You may also find it easier to follow these steps in a \npresentation\n with screenshots that we made during a FOSS4G workshop in July 2015.\n\n\nMaven Project\n\n\nThe first step is to create a new Eclipse Maven project that will contain the new sensor module, as instructed on \nthis page\n. For the sake of coherency, you should name your driver project \nsensorhub-driver-{your_driver_name}\n. In the case of the Fake Weather module, we named it \nsensorhub-driver-fakeweather\n.\n\n\nYou then need to create at least 4 classes to add a new sensor module to the SensorHub system:\n\n\n\n\nThe module configuration class\n\n\nThe main sensor module class\n\n\nAt least one sensor output class\n\n\nThe module descriptor class\n\n\n\n\nThe Module Configuration Class\n\n\nThe sensor module configuration class must be derived from \nSensorConfig\n. You can add any other properties that your sensor needs to be properly configured. This class will be directly initialized by parsing equivalent JSON properties in the main SensorHub configuration file.\n\n\nThe configuration class for the Fake Weather module is \nFakeWeatherConfig\n, where we simply added fields to specify the station location:\n\n\npublic class FakeWeatherConfig extends SensorConfig\n{\n  public double centerLatitude = 34.8038; // in deg\n  public double centerLongitude = -86.7228; // in deg\n  public double centerAltitude = 0.000; // in meters\n}\n\n\n\n\nWe recommend that you use the \n@DisplayInfo\n annotation to provide rendering hints for UI classes. An example of this is shown below:\n\n\npublic class FakeWeatherConfig extends SensorConfig\n{\n  @DisplayInfo(label=\nLatitude\n, desc=\nLatitude of Weather Station\n)\n  public double centerLatitude = 34.8038; // in deg\n\n  @DisplayInfo(label=\nLongitude\n, desc=\nLongitude of Weather Station\n)\n  public double centerLongitude = -86.7228; // in deg\n\n  @DisplayInfo(label=\nAltitude\n, desc=\nAltitude of Weather Station\n)\n  public double centerAltitude = 150.000; // in meters\n}\n\n\n\n\nBelow is a JSON snippet to be included in the main SensorHub configuration file, giving a possible configuration for the Fake Weather module:\n\n\n{\n  \nobjClass\n: \norg.sensorhub.impl.sensor.fakeweather.FakeWeatherConfig\n,\n  \nid\n: \nd136b6ea-3950-4691-bf56-c84ec7d89d73\n,\n  \nname\n: \nFake Weather Sensor\n,\n  \nenabled\n: true,\n  \nmoduleClass\n: \norg.sensorhub.impl.sensor.fakeweather.FakeWeatherSensor\n,\n  \nsensorML\n: null,\n  \nautoActivate\n: true,\n  \nenableHistory\n: false,\n  \nhiddenIO\n: null,\n  \ncenterLatitude\n: 43.6182,\n  \ncenterLongitude\n: 1.4238,\n  \ncenterAltitude\n: 150.0\n}\n\n\n\n\nThe Sensor Module Class\n\n\nThe sensor module class is the main entry point to the sensor driver implementation and must implement the generic \nISensorModule\n interface. You can implement this interface directly but in most cases you should derive from the \nAbstractSensorModule\n class instead since it already provides some functionality common to most sensors. In both cases, your must further specify your class by setting the configuration class that you defined at the previous step as its generic parameter. \n\n\nThis is shown below for the Fake Weather example:\n\n\npublic class FakeWeatherSensor extends AbstractSensorModule\nFakeWeatherConfig\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sensor module class is responsible for creating an output interface object (implementation of \nISensorDataInterface\n) for each sensor ouput and preparing the SensorML description of the sensor.\n\n\nFor the Fake Weather example module, implementation is provided in \nFakeWeatherSensor\n. This module only defines a single output and no control input. The next snippet shows the constructor where the output interface is instantiated, initialized, and appended to the output list using the \naddOutput()\n method provided by \nAbstractSensorModule\n:\n\n\npublic FakeWeatherSensor()\n{\n  dataInterface = new FakeWeatherOutput(this);\n  addOutput(dataInterface, false);\n  dataInterface.init();\n}\n\n\n\n\nThe module \nstart()\n and \nstop()\n methods must also be implemented. They must do all processing needed when the sensor is enabled or disabled respectively. In the case of the Fake Weather module, these methods simply delegate to the output interface since it is this class that actually starts/stops the measurement thread.\n\n\npublic void start() throws SensorHubException\n{\n    dataInterface.start();        \n}\n\npublic void stop() throws SensorHubException\n{\n    dataInterface.stop();\n}\n\n\n\n\nThe Sensor Output Class\n\n\nEach output interface of a sensor must be defined by a class implementing \nISensorDataInterface\n. Just like for the main sensor module class, we provide the \nAbstractSensorOutput\n base class that already implements functionalities common to most sensors, so we highly recommend that you derive from it. For instance, the sole output of the Fake Weather example sensor is defined in the \nFakeWeatherOutput\n class.\n\n\nThe main functions of the sensor output class are to:\n\n\n\n\nDefine the output data structure and encoding\n\n\nProvide the approximate/average sampling time of this output\n\n\nStart/stop measurement collection thread\n\n\nProvide access to the latest measurement record and corresponding time stamp\n\n\n\n\nDefine the output data structure and encoding\n\n\nThe snippet below is extracted from the Fake Weather example and shows how to create the measurement record structure using the \nSWEHelper\n class:\n\n\nprotected void init()\n{\n    SWEHelper fac = new SWEHelper();\n\n    // build SWE Common record structure\n    weatherData = new DataRecordImpl(5);\n    weatherData.setName(getName());\n    weatherData.setDefinition(\nhttp://sensorml.com/ont/swe/property/Weather\n);\n\n    // add time, temperature, pressure, wind speed and wind direction fields\n    weatherData.addComponent(\ntime\n, fac.newTimeStampIsoUTC());\n    weatherData.addComponent(\ntemperature\n, fac.newQuantity(SWEHelper.getPropertyUri(\nAirTemperature\n), \nAir Temperature\n, null, \nCel\n));\n    weatherData.addComponent(\npressure\n, fac.newQuantity(SWEHelper.getPropertyUri(\nAtmosphericPressure\n), \nAir Pressure\n, null, \nhPa\n));\n    weatherData.addComponent(\nwindSpeed\n, fac.newQuantity(SWEHelper.getPropertyUri(\nWindSpeed\n), \nWind Speed\n, null, \nm/s\n));\n\n    // for wind direction, we also specify a reference frame\n    Quantity q = fac.newQuantity(SWEHelper.getPropertyUri(\nWindDirection\n), \nWind Direction\n, null, \ndeg\n);\n    q.setReferenceFrame(\nhttp://sensorml.com/ont/swe/property/NED\n);\n    q.setAxisID(\nz\n);\n    weatherData.addComponent(\nwindDirection\n, q);\n\n    // also generate encoding definition\n    weatherEncoding = fac.newTextEncoding(\n,\n, \n\\n\n);\n}\n\n\n\n\nIn this case, the sensor output is a record composed of the following values:\n\n\n\n\nTime stamp (ISO time stamp expressed in UTC time frame)\n\n\nAir temperature\n\n\nAtmospheric pressure\n\n\nWind speed\n\n\nWind direction (rotation about Z axis of NED frame)\n\n\n\n\nProvide the approximate/average sampling time of this output\n\n\nThis is achieved by implementing a simple method that must return the approximative sampling period (in seconds) of data generated by this output. If the rate is known and quasi constant, the method simply returns a fixed value, as in the Fake Weather example:\n\n\npublic double getAverageSamplingPeriod()\n{\n    // sample every 1 second\n    return 1.0;\n}\n\n\n\n\nWhen the rate is not known a-priori and/or can vary, an average can be computed online (This is what is done in the \nSOS-T Virtual Sensor\n for example since there is no way to know the rate of incoming data in advance).\n\n\nStart/stop measurement collection thread\n\n\nThe measurement thread gets readings from sensor hardware and package them in a \nDataBlock\n. The sensor output must thus provide methods to start/stop the measurement thread and implement the logic for connecting to the sensor and correctly generating the \nDataBlock\n.\n\n\nIn the Fake Weather example, the \nsendMeasurement()\n method is implemented and is called regularly using a Timer thread set to execute at the frequency specified by \ngetAverageSamplingPeriod()\n.\n\n\nprivate void sendMeasurement()\n{\n    // generate new weather values\n    double time = System.currentTimeMillis() / 1000.;\n\n    // temperature; value will increase or decrease by less than 1.0 deg\n    temp += 0.005 * (2.0 *Math.random() - 1.0);\n\n    // pressure; value will increase or decrease by less than 20 hPa\n    pressure += 20. * (2.0 * Math.random() - 1.0);\n\n    // wind speed; keep positive\n    // vary value between +/- 10 m/s\n    speed += 10.0 * (2.0 * Math.random() - 1.0);\n    speed = speed \n 0.0 ? 0.0 : speed;\n\n    // wind direction; keep between 0 and 360 degrees\n    direction += 4.0 * (2.0 * Math.random() - 1.0);\n    direction = direction \n 0.0 ? direction+360.0 : direction;\n    direction = direction \n 360.0 ? direction-360.0 : direction;\n\n    // build and publish datablock\n    DataBlock dataBlock = weatherData.createDataBlock();\n    dataBlock.setDoubleValue(0, time);\n    dataBlock.setDoubleValue(1, temp);\n    dataBlock.setDoubleValue(2, pressure);\n    dataBlock.setDoubleValue(3, speed);\n    dataBlock.setDoubleValue(4, direction);\n\n    // update latest record and send event\n    latestRecord = dataBlock;\n    eventHandler.publishEvent(new SensorDataEvent(time, FakeWeatherOutput.this, dataBlock));\n}\n\nprotected void start()\n{\n    if (timer != null)\n       return;\n    timer = new Timer();\n\n    // start main measurement generation thread\n    TimerTask task = new TimerTask() {\n       public void run()\n       {\n          sendMeasurement();\n       }\n    };\n    timer.scheduleAtFixedRate(task, 0, (long)(getAverageSamplingPeriod()*1000));\n}\n\nprotected void stop()\n{\n    if (timer != null)\n    {\n        timer.cancel();\n        timer = null;\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nThe Module Descriptor Class\n\n\nA module descriptor class must be provided to enable automatic discovery of your new module by the SensorHub module registry. By providing a class implementing the \nIModuleProvider\n interface, all SensorHub modules available on the classpath can indeed be discovered using the standard Java \nServiceLoader\n API.\n\n\nThe class provides metadata about the module such as a name, description and version. It also indicates which configuration class and module class make up the module. It should thus point to the classes you created in the first two steps of this tutorial.\n\n\nThe snippet below shows the module descriptor for the Fake Weather sensor module:\n\n\npublic class FakeWeatherModuleDescriptor implements IModuleProvider\n{\n  @Override\n  public String getModuleName()\n  {\n    return \nFake Weather Sensor\n;\n  }\n\n  @Override\n  public String getModuleDescription()\n  {\n    return \nFake weather station with randomly changing measurements\n;\n  }\n\n  @Override\n  public String getModuleVersion()\n  {\n    return \n0.1\n;\n  }\n\n  @Override\n  public String getProviderName()\n  {\n    return \nBotts Innovative Research Inc\n;\n  }\n\n  @Override\n  public Class\n? extends IModule\n?\n getModuleClass()\n  {\n    return FakeWeatherSensor.class;\n  }\n\n  @Override\n  public Class\n? extends ModuleConfig\n getModuleConfigClass()\n  {\n    return FakeWeatherConfig.class;\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\nIn order to be discoverable by the \nServiceLoader\n API, the module descriptor class also needs to be advertised in a provider-configuration file called \norg.sensorhub.api.module.IModuleProvider\n in the resource directory \nMETA-INF/services\n (see \nServiceLoader\n documentation on Oracle website). For instance, the Fake Weather sensor module includes \nthis file\n file with the following line:\n\n\norg.sensorhub.impl.sensor.fakeweather.FakeWeatherModuleDescriptor",

The snippet below shows the module descriptor for the Fake Weather sensor module:  public class FakeWeatherModuleDescriptor implements IModuleProvider\n{\n  @Override\n  public String getModuleName()\n  {\n    return  Fake Weather Sensor ;\n  }\n\n  @Override\n  public String getModuleDescription()\n  {\n    return  Fake weather station with randomly changing measurements ;\n  }\n\n  @Override\n  public String getModuleVersion()\n  {\n    return  0.1 ;\n  }\n\n  @Override\n  public String getProviderName()\n  {\n    return  Botts Innovative Research Inc ;\n  }\n\n  @Override\n  public Class ? extends IModule ?  getModuleClass()\n  {\n    return FakeWeatherSensor.class;\n  }\n\n  @Override\n  public Class ? extends ModuleConfig  getModuleConfigClass()\n  {\n    return FakeWeatherConfig.class;\n  }\n}  In order to be discoverable by the  ServiceLoader  API, the module descriptor class also needs to be advertised in a provider-configuration file called  org.sensorhub.api.module.IModuleProvider  in the resource directory  META-INF/services  (see  ServiceLoader  documentation on Oracle website). For instance, the Fake Weather sensor module includes  this file  file with the following line:  org.sensorhub.impl.sensor.fakeweather.FakeWeatherModuleDescriptor",

They are often generated (at least partly) from code using the java SensorML bindings included in \nlib-sensorml\n.\n\n\nThese bindings are automatically generated from the 2.0 XML schemas and thus are a direct reflection of the types and properties that are defined by it. The general rule is that each \nXML Schema Complex Type\n (except OGC Property Types) becomes a Java interface with appropriate methods to handle each property (get/set/isSet/unSet, getNum/add for multiplicity \n 1, etc.).\n\n\nThere is one subtle difference compared to other bindings that could be generated with commonly used tools such as JAXB or XML Beans: OGC Property Types are not generated as separate objects thus removing many unnecessary layers in the generated object tree. Instead, properties are handled as a generic \nOgcProperty\n object, containing all info carried by the property such as name, xlink attributes, etc., and accessible via \n'getProperty'\n methods. This means that calls to regular get methods would return the property value directly which makes constructing the object much more straight forward. This design allows for handling the entire content model from many OGC schemas without making the resulting object tree too complex.\n\n\nLet's look at examples of how to set different parts of a SensorML document using this API (All code in the following section assumes you have an instance of \nPhysicalComponent\n or \nPhysicalSystem\n called \n'system'\n on hand).\n\n\nNote: Most of the following examples are actually extracted from the 'testGenerateInstance()' method of this \nJUnit Test Class\n so you can look at the code directly\n\n\nHigh-Level Descriptive Info\n\n\nThe first thing you need to do to create or add to a SensorML description is to instantiate SML and SWE helperfactories:\n\n\nSMLHelper smlFac = new SMLHelper();\nSWEHelper sweFac = new SWEHelper();\n\n\n\n\nThen, if you don't already have one, create the top level process or system instance.

This means that a driver implementing only the base API would have to be instantiated N times to connect to a network of N sensors. Fortunately, SensorHub also defines an extension to the base sensor API allowing one to write drivers that can wrap sensor networks of any size within a single module. Please see the \nSensor Network API\n page for more details.\n\n\nWhen implementing the base sensor API, each new sensor (or actuator) driver is composed of at least 4 classes:\n\n\n\n\nAn implementation of the \nISensorModule\n interface\n\n\nZero or more implementations of \nISensorDataInterface\n (\nat least one for a sensor\n)\n\n\nZero or more implementations of \nISensorControlInterface\n (\nat least one for an actuator\n)\n\n\nAn extension of the \nSensorConfig\n class\n\n\nAn implementation of the \nIModuleDescriptor\n interface\n\n\n\n\nDetails about these different classes are given in the next sections.\n\n\nNote: Several sensor drivers can be packaged in a single Maven module, although we encourage this only if the drivers are very closely related and/or have tight inter-dependencies.\n\n\nISensorModule\n\n\nThe \nISensorModule\n interface is the top-level one to be implemented by sensor drivers. It provides methods for:\n\n\n\n\nGetting the SensorML description of an installed sensor or actuator\n\n\nGetting the feature of interest (FOI) currently observed by the sensor\n\n\nChecking for the presence of the device\n\n\nSubscribing for high level sensor events (activation, connection, etc.)\n\n\nGiving access to the sensor measurement outputs and control inputs\n\n\n\n\nThe main functions of the sensor module are shown on the figure below:\n\n\n\n\nEach data interface is an output that gives access to a stream of sensor measurements and is an implementation of \nISensorDataInterface\n. Data interfaces are asynchornous in the sense that each of them can produce data at a different rate.\n\n\nEach control interface is an input that can receive commands and is an implementation of \nISensorControlInterface\n. Each control input can receive different types of command messages.\n\n\nA sensor module implementation must also provide the description of the sensor as a SensorML process (any class derived from \nAbstractProcess\n is acceptable). Usually, this sensor description is a mix between information auto-generated by the driver and information provided as a SensorML file by the user. Versioning and updating the sensor description can be optionnally supported by the driver.\n\n\nIn order to help you implement the API, we provide the \nAbstractSensorModule\n class that is a simple partial implementation of \nISensorModule\n and can be used as the base for most sensor modules. It provides default implementations of most methods in the API.\n\n\nISensorDataInterface\n\n\nData produced by each output must be made available by an implementation of \nISensorDataInterface\n that provides methods for:\n\n\n\n\nDescribing the data structure of each measurement record\n\n\nReading data produced by a sensor (poll mode)\n\n\nSubscribing for data produced by a sensor (push mode)\n\n\nDiscovery methods allowing to advertise if push and storage are supported\n\n\n\n\nThe measurement record description must be provided as a tree of SWE Common data components (DataRecord, DataArray, Quantity, Time, Count, etc.). This structure will automatically be used to populate the output section of the SensorML description.\n\n\nA recommended encoding must also be defined which is usually text for simple measurements and some binary flavor for imagery, video and other multi-dimensionnal datasets. \n\n\nThese components and encodings are provided by the \nlib-swe-common\n module.\n\n\nAll data streamed through the same data interface must be synchronous and time-tagged together.\n\n\nThe \nAbstractSensorOutput\n class is provided to reduce redundant code and help you get started. It is a basic partial implementation of \nISensorDataInterface\n that can be used as the base for most sensor modules.\n\n\nISensorControlInterface\n\n\nCommands can be sent to the sensor via implementations of \nISensorControlInterface\n that provides methods for:\n\n\n\n\nSending commands to the sensor/actuator (synchronous or asynchronous)\n\n\nScheduling commands to be sent asynchronously and/or at specific times\n\n\nSubscribing to events related to a command that is executed asynchronously\n\n\n\n\nThe \nAbstractSensorControl\n class is provided to reduce redundant code and help you get started. It is a basic partial implementation of \nISensorControlInterface\n that can be used as the base for most sensor modules.\n\n\nSensorConfig\n\n\nA configuration class derived from SensorConfig must be provided with the new driver. This class is used as a \nstruct\n that contain public fields carrying the configuration of the sensor module.\n\n\nAll public fields in this class are used to automatically generate the administration user interface of this particular driver. Nesting configuration classes is supported.\n\n\nYou can use the \nDisplayInfo\n annotation to give hints to the UI renderer, by providing:\n\n\n\n\nA more readable label (if non is provided, the label is automatically derived from the field name)\n\n\nA description that will show up in a popup\n\n\n\n\nAbstractSensorModule\n\n\nThe \nAbstractSensorModule\n class can serve as a base to develop most sensor drivers. It provides default implementation for the following aspects:\n\n\n\n\nKeeping maps of outputs and command inputs. Derived classes should thus call the \naddOutput()\n and \naddControlInput()\n methods\n\n\nGeneration of SensorML description (more details are given below)\n\n\n\n\nHowever, there is no default support for:\n\n\n\n\nUpdating the sensor description from outside the driver (except by changing the base SensorML file)\n\n\nMaintaining a history of sensor descriptions (this is because, by default, this feature is better handled by the persistence layer in SensorHub).\n\n\n\n\nConsequently, the \nAbstractSensorModule\n class returns \nfalse\n in the two methods reporting support of these functionalities.\n\n\nDefault workflow for generating the SensorML description\n\n\nThe default workflow shown on the figure below illustrates the way the current sensor decription is generated when you derive a concrete driver implementation from \nAbstractSensorModule\n:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOutput, control inputs and configuration parameter descriptions are actually defined by concrete driver implementation but appending to SensorML is done in \nAbstractSensorModule\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAutogenerated content is usually info obtained directly from sensor hardware\n(e.g. serial number, etc.) and/or internal driver state (e.g. depending on commands received)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIModuleDescriptor\n\n\nLike any SensorHub module, a sensor driver must implement a class derived from this interface to become discoverable.",

It provides methods for:   Getting the SensorML description of an installed sensor or actuator  Getting the feature of interest (FOI) currently observed by the sensor  Checking for the presence of the device  Subscribing for high level sensor events (activation, connection, etc.)  Giving access to the sensor measurement outputs and control inputs   The main functions of the sensor module are shown on the figure below:   Each data interface is an output that gives access to a stream of sensor measurements and is an implementation of  ISensorDataInterface . Data interfaces are asynchornous in the sense that each of them can produce data at a different rate.  Each control interface is an input that can receive commands and is an implementation of  ISensorControlInterface . Each control input can receive different types of command messages.  A sensor module implementation must also provide the description of the sensor as a SensorML process (any class derived from  AbstractProcess  is acceptable). Usually, this sensor description is a mix between information auto-generated by the driver and information provided as a SensorML file by the user. Versioning and updating the sensor description can be optionnally supported by the driver.  In order to help you implement the API, we provide the  AbstractSensorModule  class that is a simple partial implementation of  ISensorModule  and can be used as the base for most sensor modules. It provides default implementations of most methods in the API.  ISensorDataInterface  Data produced by each output must be made available by an implementation of  ISensorDataInterface  that provides methods for:   Describing the data structure of each measurement record  Reading data produced by a sensor (poll mode)  Subscribing for data produced by a sensor (push mode)  Discovery methods allowing to advertise if push and storage are supported   The measurement record description must be provided as a tree of SWE Common data components (DataRecord, DataArray, Quantity, Time, Count, etc.). This structure will automatically be used to populate the output section of the SensorML description.  A recommended encoding must also be defined which is usually text for simple measurements and some binary flavor for imagery, video and other multi-dimensionnal datasets.   These components and encodings are provided by the  lib-swe-common  module.  All data streamed through the same data interface must be synchronous and time-tagged together.  The  AbstractSensorOutput  class is provided to reduce redundant code and help you get started. It is a basic partial implementation of  ISensorDataInterface  that can be used as the base for most sensor modules.  ISensorControlInterface  Commands can be sent to the sensor via implementations of  ISensorControlInterface  that provides methods for:   Sending commands to the sensor/actuator (synchronous or asynchronous)  Scheduling commands to be sent asynchronously and/or at specific times  Subscribing to events related to a command that is executed asynchronously   The  AbstractSensorControl  class is provided to reduce redundant code and help you get started. It is a basic partial implementation of  ISensorControlInterface  that can be used as the base for most sensor modules.  SensorConfig  A configuration class derived from SensorConfig must be provided with the new driver. This class is used as a  struct  that contain public fields carrying the configuration of the sensor module.  All public fields in this class are used to automatically generate the administration user interface of this particular driver. Nesting configuration classes is supported.  You can use the  DisplayInfo  annotation to give hints to the UI renderer, by providing:   A more readable label (if non is provided, the label is automatically derived from the field name)  A description that will show up in a popup   AbstractSensorModule  The  AbstractSensorModule  class can serve as a base to develop most sensor drivers. It provides default implementation for the following aspects:   Keeping maps of outputs and command inputs. Derived classes should thus call the  addOutput()  and  addControlInput()  methods  Generation of SensorML description (more details are given below)   However, there is no default support for:   Updating the sensor description from outside the driver (except by changing the base SensorML file)  Maintaining a history of sensor descriptions (this is because, by default, this feature is better handled by the persistence layer in SensorHub).   Consequently, the  AbstractSensorModule  class returns  false  in the two methods reporting support of these functionalities.  Default workflow for generating the SensorML description  The default workflow shown on the figure below illustrates the way the current sensor decription is generated when you derive a concrete driver implementation from  AbstractSensorModule :     Output, control inputs and configuration parameter descriptions are actually defined by concrete driver implementation but appending to SensorML is done in  AbstractSensorModule    Autogenerated content is usually info obtained directly from sensor hardware\n(e.g. serial number, etc.) and/or internal driver state (e.g. depending on commands received)    IModuleDescriptor  Like any SensorHub module, a sensor driver must implement a class derived from this interface to become discoverable.",

This description usually contains the list of sensors that are part of the network as SensorML components (for large networks, this will be preferably done by reference). It is also important to include discovery related information in this description since it is the only one directly referenced by the capabilities document of SWE services.\n\n\nChanges in the network or in a given entity configuration are notified using a \nSensorEvent\n.

This corresponds to the sampled feature in the O\nM model.\n\n\nWhen one of the features of interest changes (as usually happens in networks of mobile sensors), this can be notified using an \nFoiEvent\n. If the FOI observed by one of the sensor changes (e.g. the sensor was moved to a new location), use the constructor with the entityID.\n\n\nNote: As for single sensors, the driver is only required to provide the feature of interest currently being observed.

Limitation of Liability\n\n   Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including\n   negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who\n   distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any\n   direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any\n   character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of\n   goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n   other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been\n   informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability\n   shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from\n   such party's negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such\n   limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of\n   incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may\n   not apply to You.\n\n8. Litigation\n\n   Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts\n   of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of\n   business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that\n   jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing\n   in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring cross-claims or\n   counter-claims.\n\n9. Miscellaneous\n\n   This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject\n   matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be\n   unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent\n   necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that\n   the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not\n   be used to construe this License against a Contributor.\n\n\n10. Versions of the License\n\n10.1. New Versions\n\n      Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section\n      10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or\n      publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a\n      distinguishing version number.\n\n10.2. Effect of New Versions\n\n      You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version\n      of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software,\n      or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license\n      steward.\n\n10.3. Modified Versions\n\n      If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to\n      create a new license for such software, you may create and use a\n      modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove\n      any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that\n      such modified license differs from this License).\n\n10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary\n      Licenses If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is\n      Incompatible With Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of\n      the License, the notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be\n      attached.\n\nExhibit A - Source Code Form License Notice\n\n      This Source Code Form is subject to the\n      terms of the Mozilla Public License, v.\n      2.0.

Distribution of Source Form\n\n     All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any\n     Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under\n     the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source\n     Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this\n     License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not\n     attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code\n     Form.\n\n3.2. Distribution of Executable Form\n\n     If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\n\n     a. such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form,\n        as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the\n        Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by\n        reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost\n        of distribution to the recipient; and\n\n     b. You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this\n        License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the\n        license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the\n        recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.\n\n3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work\n\n     You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,\n     provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for\n     the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered\n     Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the\n     Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this\n     License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software\n     under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of\n     the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered\n     Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary\n     License(s).\n\n3.4. Notices\n\n     You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices\n     (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or\n     limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the\n     Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the\n     extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.\n\n3.5. Application of Additional Terms\n\n     You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,\n     indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered\n     Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on\n     behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any\n     such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by\n     You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any\n     liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,\n     indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional\n     disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any\n     jurisdiction.\n\n4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation\n\n   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License\n   with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute,\n   judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of\n   this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the\n   limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be placed in a\n   text file included with all distributions of the Covered Software under\n   this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation,\n   such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary\n   skill to be able to understand it.\n\n5. Termination\n\n5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You\n     fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant,\n     then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor\n     are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor\n     explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing\n     basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by\n     some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into\n     compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are\n     reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the\n     non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the first time You have\n     received notice of non-compliance with this License from such\n     Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt\n     of the notice.\n\n5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent\n     infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,\n     counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version\n     directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to\n     You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section\n     2.1 of this License shall terminate.\n\n5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user\n     license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been\n     validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to\n     termination shall survive termination.\n\n6. Disclaimer of Warranty\n\n   Covered Software is provided under this License on an \"as is\" basis,\n   without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory,\n   including, without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free\n   of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing.\n   The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software\n   is with You. Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect,\n   You (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing,\n   repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential\n   part of this License. No use of  any Covered Software is authorized under\n   this License except under this disclaimer.\n\n7. Limitation of Liability\n\n   Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including\n   negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who\n   distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any\n   direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any\n   character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of\n   goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n   other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been\n   informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability\n   shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from\n   such party's negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such\n   limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of\n   incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may\n   not apply to You.\n\n8. Litigation\n\n   Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts\n   of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of\n   business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that\n   jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing\n   in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring cross-claims or\n   counter-claims.\n\n9. Miscellaneous\n\n   This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject\n   matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be\n   unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent\n   necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that\n   the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not\n   be used to construe this License against a Contributor.\n\n\n10.

Modified Versions\n\n      If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to\n      create a new license for such software, you may create and use a\n      modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove\n      any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that\n      such modified license differs from this License).\n\n10.4.
